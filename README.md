# FindARedditBot
Bot that reports posts and comments in /r/FindAReddit if they have a score of -3 or less.

## Setup
If you would like to use this bot for your own subreddit then all you need to do is clone
this repository and create a praw.ini file with the following contents:

```ini
[<config id>]
username=username
password=password
client_id=client_id
client_secret=client_secret
user_agent=user_agent
```

Open bot.py and replace

```python
reddit = praw.Reddit('findareddit')
```

with

```python
reddit = praw.Reddit('<config id>') 
```

and

```python
subreddit = reddit.subreddit('findareddit')
```

with the subreddit of your choice.

Change the global threshold variable to create a custom threshold for your bot.

Please do not use this bot without the permission from that subreddit's moderators.

## Usage
I recommend using cronjobs to make this bot run as frequently as you would like. 

If you are on Linux, open bash and type

```bash
crontab -e
```

This opens up a file where you can create a cronjob to be run every so often
f.x. if you want it to be run every 30 minutes you would put

```
30 * * * * * cd /FilePath/FindARedditBot; ./bot.py
```

Make sure that bot.py is executable, you can do so with

```
chmod +x bot.py
```

while in the same directory.
